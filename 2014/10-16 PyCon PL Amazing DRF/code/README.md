Amazing Web APIs with DRF @ Base
================================

Welcome to our coding session.

This will whet your appetite for creating web applications with Django and Django REST Framework.

To accomplish the task you should follow 3 steps:

1. Implement a Deal model
2. Implement a serializer for your model
3. Glue everything together in a viewset

The model should have fields like:

    name       (CharField)
    value      (IntegerField)
    updated_at (DateTimeField)


You can follow along the docs at [django-rest-framework.org](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for help.
Feel free to modify the the task if you want to try out more things!


Good luck!

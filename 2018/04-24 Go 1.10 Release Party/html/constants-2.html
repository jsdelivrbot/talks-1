      <p>The concept of <i>untyped&nbsp;constants</i> in Go means that all the
      numeric&nbsp;constants, whether integer, floating-point, complex, or even
      character values, live in a kind of unified space.</p>
      <p>It's when we bring them to the computational world of <b>variables</b>,
      <b>assignments</b>, and <b>operations</b> that the actual types
      matter.</p>

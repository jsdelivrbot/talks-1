      <p>Go 1 defines two things: first, the <b>specification of the
      language</b>; and second, the specification of a set of core APIs, the
      "<b>standard packages</b>" of the Go library.</p>
      <p>It is intended that programs written to the Go 1 specification will
      continue to compile and run correctly, unchanged, over the lifetime of
      that specification.</p>
      <p>Compatibility is at the source level.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>When designing Go, we decided to avoid this minefield [of numeric bugs
      in C code] by mandating that there is <b>no</b> mixing of numeric
      types.</p>
      <p>This strictness [...] sometimes requires programmers to decorate their
      code with clumsy numeric conversions to express their meaning clearly.</p>
      <p>[...] numeric constants work differently from how they behave in other
      C-like languages.</p>
      <p>In short, constants in Go just work, most of the time anyway.</p>
